================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

`istatapi` is a Python interface to discover and retrieve data from
ISTAT API (The Italian National Institute of Statistics). The library is
designed to explore ISTAT metadata and to retreive data in different
formats. `istatapi` is built on top of [ISTAT SDMX RESTful
API](https://developers.italia.it/it/api/istat-sdmx-rest).

Whether you are an existing organization, a curious individual or an
academic researcher, `istatapi` aims to allow you to easily access ISTAT
databases with just a few lines of code. The library implements
functions to:

- Explore all available ISTAT datasets (dataflows in SDMX terminology)
- Search available datasets by keywords
- Retrieve information on a specific dataset like: the ID of the
  dataflow, the names and available values of the dimensions of the
  dataset, available filters.
- Get data of an available dataset in a pandas DataFrame, csv or json
  format.

## Install

You can easily install the library by using the pip command:

`pip install istatapi`

## How to use

With `istatapi` we can search through all the available datasets by
simply using the following function:

`all_available()`
